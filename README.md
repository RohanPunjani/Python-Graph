Hey guys, was out whole day with family and friends.

Tired but still tried to learn about pie chart using matplotlib

Its really easy, just slices of pizza having  different toppings of different color where u can decide which slice will be bigger ....

Learning New stuffs about graph.

I made cosine function and saw that we can make many others as well!

I now tried to plot both at once and it was fairly easy.

Thinking to dig more in it.

Lets see!

I have my exam tomorrow.

The subject is PCom (Principles of Communication)

It is filled completely with `modulation`, `Analog/Digital Signals` and `Amazing Fourier Transforms` along with its different properties and soo much more.

I was studying today and seeing soo much `graphs` inspired me to visualise it using `PYTHON`.

Looked up on the internet and found how to make `Sine Function`.

Rest will add tomorrow (hopefully ^_^)!
