# Python-Graph

_25/11/2019 11:48pm_.

I have my exam tomorrow.

The subject is PCom (Principles of Communication)

It is filled completely with `modulation`, `Analog/Digital Signals` and `Amazing Fourier Transforms` along with its different properties and soo much more.

I was studying today and seeing soo much `graphs` inspired me to visualise it using `PYTHON`.

Looked up on the internet and found how to make `Sine Function`.

Rest will add tomorrow (hopefully ^_^)!
